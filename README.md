* RecyclerView (the new ListView)
* CardView (custom outline and shadow)
* Ripple animation (touch feedback)
* Palette (Incorporate dynamic color)

## Overview

The app does the following:

Suggested extensions:

1. Add ripple effect to `CardView` to provide touch feedback.
2. Use `Palette` to add dynamic color to contact item's background. Use the same color as the accent color for the views in details screen.
3. Add shared element activity transition to provide a seamless experience by emphasizing continuity between activity transitions.
4. Add a floating action button, clicking on which should enable you to directly place a call to your contact.
